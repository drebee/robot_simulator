## Installation

To install all dependencies, type the following into the Terminal (if you're on Mac) or Anaconda prompt (if you're on Windows):
```bash
conda activate cs2526
pip install pygame
conda install numpy
```

## Getting Started

Your `main.py` file is already set up with the basic structure:
```python
from simulator import robot, FORWARD, BACKWARD, STOP

# TODO: Write your code here!
# Use robot.motors() to move
# Use robot.left_sonar() and robot.right_sonar() to sense obstacles

# When you're done, close the simulator
robot.exit()
```

When you run main.py, you'll be asked:

* 'r' - Run on the real robot (in class)
* 's' - Run in the simulator (for testing)
* 'challenge' - Simulator with obstacle settings (NOT required)

## API Reference

**Motor Control:**
- `robot.motors(left, right, seconds)` - Run motors for specified time
  - `left`, `right`: Use `FORWARD` (1), `BACKWARD` (-1), or `STOP` (0)
  - `seconds`: How long to run (can be a decimal like 0.5)

**Sensors:**
- `robot.left_sonar()` - Returns distance in cm to nearest obstacle on left
- `robot.right_sonar()` - Returns distance in cm to nearest obstacle on right

**Example:**
```python
# Move forward for 2 seconds
robot.motors(FORWARD, FORWARD, 2)

# Turn right by stopping right motor
robot.motors(FORWARD, STOP, 1)

# Check distance and decide what to do
distance = robot.left_sonar()
if distance < 5:
    # Too close! Back up
    robot.motors(BACKWARD, BACKWARD, 1)
```

## Project Requirements

* [ ] at least 2 functions have return values and at least one call to the function is assigned to a variable
* [ ] each motor moves at least once
* [ ] the robot's movement changes based on at least 5 readings of the sonar sensors
* [ ] use at least 1 while loop OR recursive function call
* [ ] at least one command (user input) causes the robot to move autonomously for at least 20 seconds
